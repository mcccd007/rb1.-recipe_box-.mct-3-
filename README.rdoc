This is a rails application that I made following a Mackenzie child tutorial on Youtube. 

I did name the buttons in reverse so it might be hard to read for some but it was never intended to be viewed by anyone other than me as far as using it goes. 

It has a lot of validations built into it but it's almost the same thing as the raddit and blog page. This is might be the best version of those two pages because it allows for pictures and has an object with two more objects that belong to it and most of the routes and buttons are working. 

It's very basic in design and uses bootstrap... I kinda like it because I remember feeling very good about myself once I got it into the state it's in right now albeit it is quite basic.
